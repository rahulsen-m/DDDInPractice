- In this commit we are introducing the concept of base entity and understand about value object
- In the base entity abstract class we override the equal operator for comparing the two object
- and we also override == operator
- If we override == operator then we must override the != operator
- Lastly we also override the GetHash code. This will return the hash code of the object
- Finally we inherited the Entity class to the SnackMachine class
