- In this commit we created a unit test project 
- We added first test for Snack Machine
- We write the code for return money by setting all property value to 0
- Re-factored the code by adding new static readonly field for reuse.

    public static readonly Money None = new Money(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
